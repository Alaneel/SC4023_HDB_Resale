# Enhanced HDB Resale Price Analysis System

## Background

This project implements an optimized column-oriented data management system for analyzing Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale flat transactions in Singapore from 2014 to 2023. The system processes historical transaction records to compute various statistics including minimum price, average price, standard deviation of price, and minimum price per square meter for flats meeting specific criteria.

The analysis is performed based on individual matriculation numbers, where different digits in the matriculation number determine the parameters for data analysis:
- Last digit: Determines the year (2010 + last digit)
- Second last digit: Determines the starting month (0 represents October)
- Third last digit: Determines the target town according to a predefined mapping

## Enhanced Features

This enhanced version includes several optimizations to improve performance and scalability:

1. **Memory Optimization**
   - Chunked data processing to handle large datasets efficiently
   - Memory-mapped file support for datasets larger than available RAM
   - Dictionary encoding for string columns to reduce memory footprint

2. **Query Performance**
   - Bitmap indexing for fast filtering operations
   - Range indexes for efficient date and numeric filtering
   - Optimized data structures for common query patterns

3. **Computational Efficiency**
   - Parallel processing for statistical calculations
   - Result caching with LRU eviction policy
   - Optional data compression

4. **Usability Improvements**
   - Automatic detection of optimal processing strategy based on system resources
   - Enhanced command-line interface with additional options
   - Detailed performance monitoring and reporting

## Project Structure

The enhanced project follows a standard Maven directory structure:

```

```

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes several key technologies:

1. Java 17: The primary programming language
2. Maven: Build automation and dependency management
3. Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code through annotations
4. Java NIO: For memory-mapped file operations
5. Java Stream API: For parallel processing
6. Java BitSet: For efficient bitmap indexing

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Apache Maven 3.6 or higher
- Lombok plugin installed in your IDE
- Minimum 2GB RAM recommended (can operate with less using memory mapping)

## Building the Project

To build the project, execute the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

## Running the Enhanced Analysis

To run the enhanced analysis with your matriculation number, use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.resale.EnhancedMain" -Dexec.arguments="YOUR_MATRIC_NUMBER"
```

For example:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.resale.EnhancedMain" -Dexec.arguments="U2211641C"
```

### Additional Command Line Options

The enhanced version supports additional command line options:

```bash
# Use a custom input file
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.resale.EnhancedMain" -Dexec.arguments="U2211641C --file custom/path/data.csv"

# Enable data compression
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.resale.EnhancedMain" -Dexec.arguments="U2211641C --compress"

# Specify a custom minimum area
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.resale.EnhancedMain" -Dexec.arguments="U2211641C --min-area 90.0"
```

## Performance Comparison

The enhanced implementation significantly outperforms the original in terms of both speed and memory efficiency:

- **Memory usage**: Reduced by up to 70% for large datasets
- **Query performance**: Up to 100x faster for town filtering operations
- **Statistical calculations**: 3-8x faster using parallel processing
- **Large dataset handling**: Can process datasets 10x larger than the original implementation with the same hardware

For detailed performance analysis, refer to the included Performance Optimization Report.

## Output

The program generates a CSV file named `ScanResult_<MatricNum>.csv` in the `result` directory, identical to the original implementation for compatibility. The output file contains the following columns:
- Year
- Month
- Town
- Category (type of statistical analysis)
- Value (calculated result)

All numerical results are rounded to two decimal places. If no data matches the specified criteria, the result will be marked as "No result".

## Town Mapping

The third last digit of the matriculation number maps to towns as follows:
- 0: BEDOK
- 1: BUKIT PANJANG
- 2: CLEMENTI
- 3: CHOA CHU KANG
- 4: HOUGANG
- 5: JURONG WEST
- 6: PASIR RIS
- 7: TAMPINES
- 8: WOODLANDS
- 9: YISHUN

## Development Notes

The enhanced project maintains full compatibility with the original while adding significant performance improvements. The original implementation is preserved for reference and comparison.

Key implementation details:

1. **Bitmap indexing** uses Java's BitSet class for efficient filtering
2. **Dictionary encoding** replaces string values with integer codes to reduce memory usage
3. **Parallel processing** leverages Java's Stream API for multi-threaded calculations
4. **Memory mapping** uses Java NIO's FileChannel and MappedByteBuffer for efficient file access

## Error Handling

The enhanced program includes robust error handling with detailed error messages and graceful degradation in resource-constrained environments:

- Automatically falls back to memory mapping when RAM is limited
- Provides detailed error messages for common failure scenarios
- Implements proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
