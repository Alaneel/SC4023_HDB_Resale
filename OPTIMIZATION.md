# HDB Resale Analysis System: Performance Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

This report details the enhancements made to the HDB Resale Analysis System to significantly improve its performance and scalability. The optimizations focus on three key areas:

1. **Memory Management**: Implementing techniques to handle datasets too large to fit in main memory
2. **Query Performance**: Speeding up data scanning with specialized indexing and data structures
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Enhancing processing speed through parallelization and compression

These improvements allow the system to efficiently process significantly larger datasets while reducing memory consumption and execution time.

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Memory Management Enhancements

#### 1.1 Chunked Data Processing

**Implementation**: The enhanced system splits data into fixed-size chunks (default: 100,000 rows per chunk) rather than loading the entire dataset into a single array.

**Benefits**:
- More efficient memory utilization
- Better cache locality for operations on specific chunks
- Enables partial garbage collection without unloading the entire dataset

```java
// Initialize chunk data structures
private List<List<Integer>> monthChunks;
private List<List<Integer>> townChunks;
private List<List<Double>> floorAreaChunks;
private List<List<Double>> resalePriceChunks;
```

#### 1.2 Memory-Mapped File Support

**Implementation**: Added support for memory-mapped files that allow direct access to file content without loading it entirely into memory.

**Benefits**:
- Can process datasets much larger than available RAM
- Operating system handles paging, reducing manual memory management overhead
- Enables efficient random access to large files

```java
// Map the entire file into memory
MappedByteBuffer buffer = channel.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0, fileSize);
```

#### 1.3 Automatic Memory Usage Detection

**Implementation**: The system automatically detects available memory and selects the appropriate loading strategy.

**Benefits**:
- Adapts to different system configurations
- Prevents out-of-memory errors on systems with limited RAM
- Optimizes performance based on available resources

```java
private static boolean shouldUseMemoryMapping() {
    long maxMemory = Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory();
    // Use memory mapping if available memory is limited
    return maxMemory < MIN_MEMORY_FOR_STANDARD;
}
```

### 2. Query Performance Optimizations

#### 2.1 Bitmap Indexing

**Implementation**: Created bitmap indexes for categorical data (towns) and common query conditions.

**Benefits**:
- Extremely fast filtering operations using bitwise operations
- Compact representation of filter results
- Efficient combination of multiple filtering criteria

```java
// Build town bitmap index
for (String town : townDictionary.keySet()) {
    BitSet bitSet = new BitSet(totalRows);
    int townCode = townDictionary.get(town);
    
    // Set bits for matching rows
    // ...
    
    townBitmapIndex.put(town, bitSet);
}
```

#### 2.2 Range Indexing

**Implementation**: Implemented specialized range indexes for date ranges and numeric thresholds.

**Benefits**:
- Fast filtering for range queries without scanning all records
- Efficient handling of common filtering patterns
- Reduced computational overhead for range comparisons

```java
// Build floor area range index (for efficient minimum area filtering)
double[] thresholds = {60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0, 100.0, 120.0, 150.0};
    
for (double threshold : thresholds) {
    BitSet bitSet = new BitSet(totalRows);
    // Set bits for values meeting the threshold
    // ...
    floorAreaRangeIndex.put(threshold, bitSet);
}
```

#### 2.3 Dictionary Encoding

**Implementation**: Replaced string values with integer codes for towns and months.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced memory footprint
- Faster equality comparisons
- More efficient storage and retrieval

```java
// Encode months (add to dictionary if not present)
int monthCode = monthDictionary.computeIfAbsent(month, k -> {
    int code = monthDictionary.size();
    reverseMonthDictionary.put(code, k);
    return code;
});
```

### 3. Computational Efficiency Improvements

#### 3.1 Parallel Processing

**Implementation**: Added parallel processing capabilities for statistical calculations on large datasets.

**Benefits**:
- Utilizes multiple CPU cores for faster processing
- Significantly improves performance for computation-intensive operations
- Adaptive based on dataset size (only uses parallelism when beneficial)

```java
private double calculateMinPriceParallel(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> chunkIndices) {
    return chunkIndices.entrySet().parallelStream()
            .map(entry -> {
                // Process each chunk in parallel
                // ...
            })
            .reduce(Double.MAX_VALUE, Math::min);
}
```

#### 3.2 Result Caching

**Implementation**: Implemented a query result cache with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy.

**Benefits**:
- Avoids redundant calculations for repeated queries
- Significantly reduces response time for cached queries
- Intelligently manages cache size to prevent memory issues

```java
// Check cache first
if (queryCache.containsKey(queryKey)) {
    // Update cache access order
    cacheKeys.remove(queryKey);
    cacheKeys.add(0, queryKey);
    return queryCache.get(queryKey);
}
```

#### 3.3 Data Compression Options

**Implementation**: Added optional data compression to reduce memory footprint.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced memory usage
- Better cache utilization
- Potential performance improvements due to reduced memory bandwidth needs

```java
public void compressData() {
    if (isCompressed) {
        return; // Already compressed
    }
    
    try {
        // Compress each chunk for each column
        for (int i = 0; i < monthChunks.size(); i++) {
            monthChunks.set(i, compressIntegerList(monthChunks.get(i)));
            townChunks.set(i, compressIntegerList(townChunks.get(i)));
        }
        
        isCompressed = true;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.err.println("Error compressing data: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Adaptive Optimization

The enhanced system adaptively selects the optimal execution strategy based on:

1. **Available memory**: Uses memory mapping for large datasets on memory-constrained systems
2. **Dataset size**: Only applies parallelism when the dataset is large enough to benefit
3. **Query complexity**: Uses different optimization strategies based on query characteristics

### Extensibility

The enhanced design includes several extension points:

1. **Pluggable compression algorithms**: The system can be extended with additional compression strategies
2. **Configurable chunk sizes**: Chunk size can be tuned based on dataset characteristics
3. **Customizable indexing**: Index creation can be tailored to specific query patterns

## Conclusion

The optimizations implemented in the enhanced HDB Resale Analysis System significantly improve its performance, scalability, and memory efficiency. The system can now handle datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than before while providing faster query response times and more efficient resource utilization.

These improvements make the system suitable for production use cases with stringent performance requirements and large datasets. The adaptive nature of the optimizations ensures good performance across a wide range of hardware configurations and dataset characteristics.
